This is a small project I coded for my IT classes. It features:

- registering (with activation code)
- logging in
- following and unfollowing other users
- sending messages to other users
- mentioning other users
- searching
- hashtags
- simple profiles

It probably has alot of bugs since it was my first contact with PHP and MySQL.
